      <p id="p1">Supervised learning, also known as supervised machine learning, 
        is a subcategory of machine learning and artificial intelligence. 
        It is defined by its use of labeled datasets to train algorithms that 
        to classify data or predict outcomes accurately.</p>

      <h3 id="h2">Unsupervised</h3>
      <p id="p1">Unsupervised learning, also known as unsupervised machine learning, 
        uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets. 
        These algorithms discover hidden patterns or data groupings without the need for
        human intervention.</p>

      <h3 id="h3">Reinforcement</h3>
      <p id="p1">Reinforcement learning (RL) is an area of machine learning concerned with 
        how intelligent agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize 
        the notion of cumulative reward.</p>
